##### This is a solution for report code challenge related to full stack development job position. I used below technologies and tools to complete the code challenge in a short time.

#### •	Front-end: TypeScript-React-Redux-Bootstrap-Sass-Metronic componenets

#### •	Back-end: AWS Amplify – AWS cognito – AWS Rest API – AWS Lambda function – AWS DynamoDB – AWS S3 bucket.

## The description of this code challenge:

There is a work.csv and work.json. Both contain the same data; you only need to use one (whatever you find useful). This file contains the work results of the children in one class over a month.

Create a report or screen or whatever that gives a teacher an overview of how their class worked today and on what. It is now Tuesday 2015-03-24 11:30:00 UTC. The answers after that time are therefore not yet shown.

Create a pull request in which you have included at least a readme that explains what you need to do to view the result.
