##### This is a solution for report code challenge related to full stack development job position. I used below technologies and tools to complete the code challenge in a short time.

#### •	Front-end: TypeScript-React-Redux-Bootstrap-Sass-Metronic componenets

#### •	Back-end: AWS Amplify – AWS cognito – AWS Rest API – AWS Lambda function – AWS DynamoDB – AWS S3 bucket.

## The description of this code challenge:

There is a work.csv and work.json. Both contain the same data; you only need to use one (whatever you find useful). This file contains the work results of the children in one class over a month.

Create a report or screen or whatever that gives a teacher an overview of how their class worked today and on what. It is now Tuesday 2015-03-24 11:30:00 UTC. The answers after that time are therefore not yet shown.

Create a pull request in which you have included at least a readme that explains what you need to do to view the result.


### How we should complete this code challenge?!

This assignment is expressly formulated broadly. You may use the techniques and tools you prefer to use. You can spend your time on the aspects that you consider most important. There is no time to do everything: make a choice. At this challenge, we work with C#, .NET, Typescript and Angular. But we think a good programmer on another platform will pick that up quickly enough. You may use frameworks and libraries. You may convert the data into another format or import it into databases. Then explain in the readme how someone else can get it working. The minimum requirement in the assignment is "what did my class work on today". This can be in a list, in a graphical form, it can be as numbers or colors. You can compare it with last week or an average score.
